# SBF_SNeIa_H0
For Khetan et al. 2020 containing the codes and data for SBF calibration of Sne Ia and hubble constant estimation

/lcfit_data/ folder contains the data files for the three samples used in the work : The SBF sample, SHOES sample and the hubble flow 'Low z' sample.
There are tables conatining the LC fit parameters from SNooPy along with the stellar masses of the host galaxies.

/noHM/ folder has the full analysis codes for the SBF and SHOES samples as calibrators. This analysis does not contain mass correction in the calibration.

/Linear_HM/ folder has the full analysis codes for the SBF and SHOES samples as calibrators. This analysis contais linear mass correction in the calibration.

/Step_HM/ folder has the full analysis codes for the SBF and SHOES samples as calibrators. This analysis contais step based mass correction in the calibration.
